# Test corrections number 2

# Conditional inside of a loop 

This question displays the following code segment 

index <-- 1

sum <-- 0

REPEAT UNTIL (index > 10)
{
     if (index MOD 3 = 0)
     {
         sum <-- sum + index
     }
  index <-- index + 2
}

DISPLAY sum 

This question falls under the Algorithms and Programing section

The answers to this promblem were 

3

9

12

55

I answered that after the code segment is excuted it would return 3 this is incorrect because index starts at 1 and the condition is that we add 2 to index every time it's not greater than 10. since the index adds up by 2 this proccess will be repeated 5 times nd index will become 11. Now since the condition has been met we move onto to the next thing 

if (index MOD 3 = 0)

this checks if any of the numbers in index were a multiple of 3. 3 and 9 are the only multiples so this condition becomes true after that we move down to 

sum <-- sum + index 

now we add both 3 and 9 to sum which is equal to zero so we get 12 which is the correct answer. 

as to no get this wrong again ill make sure to pay closer attention to what the problem is asking and to the code being displayed. and ill make sure to study more.
