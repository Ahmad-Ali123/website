# Is a teenager 

I answered this promblem incorrectly because I didnt pay eniugh attention to the directions. the pronblem asked witch code segment would NOT be able to tell if someone is a teenager.
I didnt see the not and answered one that could tell if someone is a teenager the correct anser was D and I picked C

# Current Value
 
 For this promblem I picked A when the asnwer was D.
the promblem was displaying 

a = 3
b = 5

a = a + b
b = a + b
c = a + b

instead of adding 5+3 and then reassinging A's value then B's value i though that A and B were the same all along when they changed so instead of setting 

c = 8 + 13

I said C was equal to 

c = 5 + 3
 giving me the wrong answer 

# Lock Icon

This question askes when navigating to a new website, there is a small lock icon to the left of the URL. What does this indicate.

it was pretty embarrsing that i got this one wrong.

I choose C which said 

Packets sent to the website are routed through a set of locked routers 

The correct answer was B which said 

Communications with the website are encrypted and it has a valid SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate. 
to avoid making a silly mistake like this in the future all make sure to rewatch all the code.org videos on websites and computers.

# Hacking Bank Accounts 

This promblem shows us a scenario in which hackers gained acess to several usernames and passwords to peoples bank account. WHat would be the best approach to ensure that hackers will not be able to access any of the bank accounts 

I said to 

update the SSL certificate for the bank's website 

when the correct answer was to ENable 2 factor authentication so that clients have to put in a passord and then a secured code gets sent to their phone.
This is correct because it's extremly diffcult for people to hack another persons phone.

I will make sure to study this promblem in the future to ensure that i never get it wrong again

# Fault Tolerant internet 

 This question asks Which of the following is NOT an example of the fault tolerance of the internet 

This was another case of me not reading the qestion carefully 

I answered 

TCP ensures that all packests are delivered even though they make tak different routes and arrive in different orders they can still be reconstucted into an exact copy of the data transferred.

Since the question asked Which is NOT an example of the fualt telorance of the internet the correct answer was 

Websites allow you to reset your passowrd if you forgot yours.

In the future ill make sure to read the question more carefully as to avoid getting it wrong.

# Next Number 

This promblem askes 

An 8-digit binary number is shown below 

1101 0111

Which of the following is the correct binary representation of the next greatest integer

I picked 1111 0000

the correct answer was 

1101 1000

I got this one wrong because im not good at converting binary to integer and vise versa 

I'll try to study binary more in the future as to avoid getting this wrong again.

# Pizza Shop

This was just another case of binary and decimal conversion 

once again ill make sure to study this in the future as to not get it wrong again.

# Basketball Handedness 

The question basically asked 
if a basket ball orginaztion represent the handedness of there players 1 being right handed and 0 being left handed the binary numbers are stored as decimals what players wold be left handed if the decimal repesentation was 19

I got this one wrong because Im bad at binary conversions 

Ill try to practice to avoid getting it wrong in the future
